Design a Streamlit application that serves as a platform for users to conduct explorative data analysis (EDA) and elementary model 

training:

Data Upload:

Create an option for users to upload their dataset. Ensure the application supports common data formats like CSV, Excel, etc.

Explorative Data Analysis (EDA):

Once the dataset is uploaded, provide users with all the EDA options such as:
Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
Generating summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.).
Allow the user to select a target variable.
Plotting distributions of numerical variables.
Visualizing relationships between variables (scatter plots, correlation matrices, etc.).
Handling missing data. Make sure you display the steps involved in dealing with missing data. 
Feature engineering. Remove unnecessary features by using any suitable feature selection techniques.
Remember to allow users to select specific columns or variables they want to analyze.

Model Training:

Provide options for users to select model type (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.).
Include options for splitting the dataset into training and test sets. Ensure users can define the split ratio.
Allow users to train the chosen model on the training data.
Model Metrics Display:

After model training, compute and display relevant model metrics such as:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Mean Squared Error (MSE).
R-squared.
Confusion Matrix (for classification tasks).
Other relevant metrics are based on the model type.
These metrics should be presented in an easily interpretable manner.
Make sure the model metrics are relevant to the model that was built.

Additional Considerations:

Ensure the interface is user-friendly and intuitive.
Provide tooltips or help sections to guide users on how to use different features of the application.
Make sure to handle potential errors or exceptions that might arise, especially during data upload and model training.
