It will handle the user interface and call functions from other files to perform tasks like data upload, EDA, model training, and metrics display.\n\n2. `data_upload.py`: This file will contain functions for uploading and reading data files in various formats.\n\n3. `eda.py`: This file will contain functions for performing exploratory data analysis.\n\n4. `model_training.py`: This file will contain functions for training machine learning models.\n\n5. `model_metrics.py`: This file will contain functions for computing and displaying model metrics.\n\n6. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python libraries that our application depends on.\n\nLet's start with the `requirements.txt`
