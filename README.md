To implement this, we will need several Python libraries such as streamlit, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and others. We will also need to create several Python files to organize our code properly. Here's a list of the core files and their purposes:

1. `app.py`: This is the main entry point of our Streamlit application. It will handle the user interface and call functions from other files to perform tasks like data upload, EDA, model training, and metrics display.

2. `data_upload.py`: This file will contain functions for uploading and reading data files in various formats.

3. `eda.py`: This file will contain functions for performing exploratory data analysis.

4. `model_training.py`: This file will contain functions for training machine learning models.

5. `model_metrics.py`: This file will contain functions for computing and displaying model metrics.

6. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python libraries that our application depends on.

Let's start with the `requirements.txt` file:
